Race Management Game:

- Add own racer to control run mode
- make it possible to choose route

- crossroads based pathfinding:
	create higher layer network where crossroad points are the nodes and the combined transitions between crossroads are edges
	for pathfinding, first calculate both path costs from current point to the next crossroad in both direction
	then do the same for the finish point
	then search cheapest paths StartCrossroad1 -> EndCrossroad1, StartCrossroad2 -> EndCrossroad1, StartCrossroad1 -> EndCrossroad2, StartCrossroad2 -> EndCrossroad2
		disallow going in direction where we came from at first crossroads
	combine these elements to find cheapest path

- add real racer attributes/traits instead of just speed modifiers

- implement rest stop functionality

- render line features wider when passing a zoom threshold to still see them
- continue new desert area (add zhulang ruins)


- race types: Fixed Route, Laps, A -> B (free route), Collect all checkpoints (OL/Dijkstra)
- race modifers: starting money, transport allowed y/n, shopping allowed y/n, etc.

- hunger
- weather
- temperature
- chance-based events (on line feature attributes, based on weather, stamina, hunger, etc.)
- injuries
- equipment
- money
- inventory, shops
- fixed transport routes (trains, ferries that depart at fixed time, pay at each station, when leaving first in first out with small delays)

- tactical layer (overworld)


Editor Features:

- add action in edit point feature tool "detach"
 - available if feature point is connected to other features
 - clicking will create a new point close to the original point and move the selected point feature to it

- Holding ctrl should disable snapping
	- or maybe even disable snapping by default, and hold ctrl to enable

- add checkbox to mark if a line feature is a bridge => draw it with outline, use for water, crossings over other paths
