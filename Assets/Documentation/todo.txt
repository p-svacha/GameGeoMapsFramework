######### RACE MANAGEMENT GAME

- Add own racer to control run mode
- make it possible to choose route

- add real racer attributes/traits instead of just speed modifiers

- implement rest stop functionality

- render line features wider when passing a zoom threshold to still see them
- continue new desert area (add zhulang ruins)

- new attribute affecting sprint speed

- race types: Fixed Route, Laps, A -> B (free route), Collect all checkpoints (OL/Dijkstra)
- race modifers: starting money, transport allowed y/n, shopping allowed y/n, etc.

- hunger
- weather
- temperature
- chance-based events (on line feature attributes, based on weather, stamina, hunger, etc.)
- injuries
- equipment
- money
- inventory, shops
- fixed transport routes (trains, ferries that depart at fixed time, pay at each station, when leaving first in first out with small delays)

- tactical layer (overworld)


######### EDITOR

- add action in edit point feature tool "detach"
 - available if feature point is connected to other features
 - clicking will create a new point close to the original point and move the selected point feature to it

- Holding ctrl should disable snapping
	- or maybe even disable snapping by default, and hold ctrl to enable

- add checkbox to mark if a line feature is a bridge => draw it with outline, use for water, crossings over other paths

- support elevation


######### FRAMEWORK

- proper elevation
	- 2 new int attributes "StartElevation" and "EndElevation" for line features
	- from these 2 the slope of the line feature is calculated
	- slope is the same on every point on a line feature (gets calculated and stored at same points as length)
	- make it clear which one is the start point and which one the end point
	- add buttons "jump to start point", "jump to end point" to actions
	- when loading a map, give warning when a point is connected to two line features but with different elevation at that point
		- better even, show red exclamation mark in editor
	- visually just handled with area features
	- maybe add new "visual line features" like contour lines which may connect to self
		- use for contour lines: do a 0m contour where elevation starts, and 100m where it ends and only use 100m increments in elevations
		- and then just use the mountain area defs at rly high elevations (500m intervals maybe)

- crossroads based pathfinding:
	create higher layer network where crossroad points are the nodes and the combined transitions between crossroads are edges
	for pathfinding, first calculate both path costs from current point to the next crossroad in both direction
	then do the same for the finish point
	then search cheapest paths StartCrossroad1 -> EndCrossroad1, StartCrossroad2 -> EndCrossroad1, StartCrossroad1 -> EndCrossroad2, StartCrossroad2 -> EndCrossroad2
		disallow going in direction where we came from at first crossroads
	combine these elements to find cheapest path
